                Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

                push(x) — Push element x onto stack.
                pop() — Removes the element on top of the stack.
                top() — Get the top element.
                getMin() — Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

            What is LIFO
        </pre>
        <pre>
                LIFO is a short form of Last In First Out. It refers how data is accessed, stored and retrieved. Using this scheme, data that was stored last should be the one to be extracted first. This also means that in order to gain access to the first data, all the other data that was stored before this first data must first be retrieved and extracted.

        <pre>Differentiate STACK from ARRAY.</pre>
        <pre>
                Stack follows a LIFO pattern. It means that data access follows a sequence wherein the last data to be stored when the first one to be extracted. Arrays, on the other hand, does not follow a particular order and instead can be accessed by referring to the indexed element within the array.

        <pre>Implement two Stacks using an Array </pre>
        <pre>


                Method 1 (Divide the space in two halves)
                A simple way to implement two stacks is to divide the array in two halves and assign the half half space to two stacks, i.e., use arr[0] to arr[n/2] for stack1, and arr[(n/2) + 1] to arr[n-1] for stack2 where arr[] is the array to be used to implement two stacks and size of array be n.
                
                The problem with this method is inefficient use of array space. A stack push operation may result in stack overflow even if there is space available in arr[]. For example, say the array size is 6 and we push 3 elements to stack1 and do not push anything to second stack2. When we push 4th element to stack1, there will be overflow even if we have space for 3 more elements in array.
                
                Method 2 (A space efficient implementation)
                This method efficiently utilizes the available space. It doesn’t cause an overflow if there is space available in arr[]. The idea is to start two stacks from two extreme corners of arr[]. stack1 starts from the leftmost element, the first element in stack1 is pushed at index 0. The stack2 starts from the rightmost corner, the first element in stack2 is pushed at index (n-1). Both stacks grow (or shrink) in opposite direction. To check for overflow, all we need to check is for space between top elements of both stacks. This check is highlighted in the below code.

        <pre>How to implement k stacks using an array ? 
                Create a data structure kStacks that represents k stacks. Implementation of kStacks should use only one array, i.e., k stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by kStacks.

                push(int x, int sn) –> pushes x to stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1
                pop(int sn) –> pops an element from stack number ‘sn’ where sn is from 0 to k-1
        </pre>
        <pre>
                Method 1 (Divide the array in slots of size n/k)
                A simple way to implement k stacks is to divide the array in k slots of size n/k each, and fix the slots for different stacks, i.e., use arr[0] to arr[n/k-1] for first stack, and arr[n/k] to arr[2n/k-1] for stack2 where arr[] is the array to be used to implement two stacks and size of array be n.
                
                The problem with this method is inefficient use of array space. A stack push operation may result in stack overflow even if there is space available in arr[]. For example, say the k is 2 and array size (n) is 6 and we push 3 elements to first and do not push anything to second second stack. When we push 4th element to first, there will be overflow even if we have space for 3 more elements in array.
                
                Method 2 (A space efficient implementation)
                The idea is to use two extra arrays for efficient implementation of k stacks in an array. This may not make much sense for integer stacks, but stack items can be large for example stacks of employees, students, etc where every item is of hundreds of bytes. For such large stacks, the extra space used is comparatively very less as we use two integer arrays as extra space.
                
                Following are the two extra arrays are used:
                1) top[]: This is of size k and stores indexes of top elements in all stacks.
                2) next[]: This is of size n and stores indexes of next item for the items in array arr[]. Here arr[] is actual array that stores k stacks.
                Together with k stacks, a stack of free slots in arr[] is also maintained. The top of this stack is stored in a variable ‘free’.

        <pre>How to create mergable stack?
                Design a stack with following operations.

                a) push(Stack s, x): Adds an item x to stack s
                b) pop(Stack s): Removes the top item from stack s
                c) merge(Stack s1, Stack s2): Merge contents of s2 into s1.
        </pre>
        <pre>

                If we use array implementation of stack, then merge is not possible to do in O(1) time as we have to do following steps.
                a) Delete old arrays
                b) Create a new array for s1 with size equal to size of old array for s1 plus size of s2.
                c) Copy old contents of s1 and s2 to new array for s1
                The above operations take O(n) time.
                
                We can use a linked list with two pointers, one pointer to first node (also used as top when elements are added and removed from beginning). The other pointer is needed for last node so that we can quickly link the linked list of s2 at the end of s1. Following are all operations.
                a) push(): Adds the new item at the beginning of linked list using first pointer.
                b) pop(): Removes an item from beginning using first pointer.
                c) merge(): Links the first pointer second stack as next of last pointer of first list.
                
                Can we do it if we are not allowed to use extra pointer?
                We can do it with circular linked list. The idea is to keep track of last node in linked list. The next of last node indicates top of stack.
                a) push(): Adds the new item as next of last node.
                b) pop(): Removes next of last node.
                c) merge(): Links the top (next of last) of second list to the top (next of last) of first list. And makes last of second list as last of whole list.

                An approach that uses O(1) time and O(n) extra space is discussed here.

                In this article, a new approach is discussed that supports minimum with O(1) extra space. We define a variable minEle that stores the current minimum element in the stack. Now the interesting part is, how to handle the case when minimum element is removed. To handle this, we push “2x – minEle” into the stack instead of x so that previous minimum element can be retrieved using current minEle and its value stored in stack. Below are detailed steps and explanation of working.
                
                Push(x) : Inserts x at the top of stack.
                
                    If stack is empty, insert x into the stack and make minEle equal to x.
                    If stack is not empty, compare x with minEle. Two cases arise:
                        If x is greater than or equal to minEle, simply insert x.
                        If x is less than minEle, insert (2*x – minEle) into the stack and make minEle equal to x. For example, let previous minEle was 3. Now we want to insert 2. We update minEle as 2 and insert 2*2 – 3 = 1 into the stack.
                
                Pop() : Removes an element from top of stack.
                
                    Remove element from top. Let the removed element be y. Two cases arise:
                        If y is greater than or equal to minEle, the minimum element in the stack is still minEle.
                        If y is less than minEle, the minimum element now becomes (2*minEle – y), so update (minEle = 2*minEle – y). This is where we retrieve previous minimum from current minimum and its value in stack. For example, let the element to be removed be 1 and minEle be 2. We remove 1 and update minEle as 2*2 – 1 = 3.

                Important Points:
                
                    Stack doesn’t hold actual value of an element if it is minimum so far.
                    Actual minimum element is always stored in minEle

        <pre>Write an algorithm to convert infix to postfix expression</pre>
        <pre>
                1. Scan the infix expression from left to right.
                2. If the scanned character is an operand, output it.
                3. Else,
                …..3.1 If the precedence of the scanned operator is greater than the precedence of the operator in the stack(or the stack is empty or the stack contains a ‘(‘ ), push it.
                …..3.2 Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are greater than or equal to in precedence than that of the scanned operator. After doing that Push the scanned operator to the stack. (If you encounter parenthesis while popping then stop there and push the scanned operator in the stack.)
                4. If the scanned character is an ‘(‘, push it to the stack.
                5. If the scanned character is an ‘)’, pop the stack and and output it until a ‘(‘ is encountered, and discard both the parenthesis.
                6. Repeat steps 2-6 until infix expression is scanned.
                7. Print the output
                8. Pop and output from the stack until it is not empty.
