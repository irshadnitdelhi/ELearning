                Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

                push(x) — Push element x onto stack.
                pop() — Removes the element on top of the stack.
                top() — Get the top element.
                getMin() — Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

            What is LIFO
        </q>
        <code>
                LIFO is a short form of Last In First Out. It refers how data is accessed, stored and retrieved. Using this scheme, data that was stored last should be the one to be extracted first. This also means that in order to gain access to the first data, all the other data that was stored before this first data must first be retrieved and extracted.

        <q>Differentiate STACK from ARRAY.</q>
        <code>
                Stack follows a LIFO pattern. It means that data access follows a sequence wherein the last data to be stored when the first one to be extracted. Arrays, on the other hand, does not follow a particular order and instead can be accessed by referring to the indexed element within the array.
